I was in charge of the splashes and ripple effects using FLIP Fluid simulation in Houdini, aided in set dressing and caches. Verified renders and handled communication between Batam and Singapore Division & Sunrise Animation. I aid in setting up lighting for various characters and composited multiple shots, colour correcting and colour grading in Nuke according to the moodboard that Sunrise Animation provided.

Working on Jungle Beats has been an eye-opener, especially working in a large pipeline production. I was able to learn a range of skills, from set dressing to fluid simulation and compositing and with guidance from the lead.
